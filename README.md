LegaC Launcher
===============

A Minecraft launcher made with GTK and Curl in pure C.

The main goal is to provide the old looking style of the Minecraft launcher,
while mainting new features that modern launchers have.

Usage
-----

To install it is really simple. Clone, enter, make, run, rage.
```shell
git clone https://gitlab.com/SimplyCEO/LegaC-Launcher.git
cd LegaC-Launcher
make BUILD_TYPE=Release
./legac_launcher
```

TODO
----

There are nothing much dynamic at this point, since the launcher was tested
for a specific version.

Why? Because it took me almost an entire week to understand how all of this works.

The initial code given here works as intended, but not how it should be... there
WILL be more work to do.

Until then, this might be the first open source Minecraft launcher available in C.
